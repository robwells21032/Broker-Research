I used a version of BrokerCheck, along with SEC and state securities regulators records, in the early 1990s to publish a data series of the AP on Wall Street brokers and fines. I’ve spent a lot of time with this data

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today’s Task
============

Find news, research politicians, campaign contributors, etc. using databases of brokers, financial advisers, investment professionals

These are all free databases

<br>

Will you find a Smoking Gun in BrokerCheck? Maybe. Better to think of it as another tool in our reporting. It overlaps somewhat with news and legal databases.

**It’s very useful but not definitive.** Remember BrokerCheck *isn’t perfect.* You have to pick up the phone and knock on doors to check this out and fully report out the story. It’s worth speaking to a regulator and the broker about the information found here so you have the right context search.

Chances are, many of your readers aren’t using this. A 2009 study (sponsored by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation): only 15% who used a financial services provider in the last five years claimed to have checked the background, registration, or license of a financial services provider.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four Databases We Will Use
==========================

### FINRA BrokerCheck

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BrokerCheck
===========

**FINRA** (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority): Industry group that licenses and polices stock brokers.

FINRA is a "self-regulatory organization." It works with and is overseen by Securities and Exchange Commission.

The BrokerCheck data is dervied from the Central Registration Depository, which was launched 1981 as a licensing and disciplinary database for the brokerage industry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to Search It

> Having a CRD number speeds your search. CRDs are available on complaints, aribtration records Searching by Zip Code can help survey activity in your community For example, a search of my Fayetteville, Ark. zip code - 72701 - brings up 411 brokers in town and surrounding cities.

### Key Items In BrokerCheck

> **For Firms:**
> -- Overview of the firm, and ownership
> -- History, including any mergers or name changes
> -- Summary of firm’s operations, list of fines, regulatory actions, arbitration awards

> **For Individuals:**
> -- Broker credentials, current registrations, licenses and exams
> -- Employment history for the past 10 years
> -- Any customer disputes or regulatory events on the broker’s record

> **These records come with major caveats:**
> -- The documents available do not all represent final actions
> -- Cases may not be fully resolved
> -- Early stages: Disciplinary complaint represents the initiation of a formal proceeding
> -- Findings and sanctions imposed in FINRA Decisions may be increased, decreased, modified or reversed

<br>

<br>

![](images%20-%20storage/Stephens%20employment.jpeg)

> With this individual, who happens to be CEO of one of the biggest investment banks west of the Mississippi, BrokerCheck does not show any red flags: 35 years in the industry and no complaints.
> What is useful is a review of his board memberships and outside activities. There's a lot of detail that would be useful for a local political reporter.

### Key things in a broker’s record.

> **Unsuitable Investments** – sale of investments that are more risky than sought by the customer

> **Churning** – Excessive trading in an account to generate fees

> **10b5** – The main federal antifraud rule

> **Breach of Fiduciary Duty** – Not putting the client’s interests’ first

He pocketed $265,000 in commissions while two customers lost $78,000, FINRA said. Another four customers suffered unrealized losses of about $1.4 million, according to FINRA. His employer has paid out some $2 million in settlements.

### Examples of stories

![](images%20-%20storage/Kelley%20article.png)

Here is an example of news you can dig out by reading the disciplined broker release every month. I did not see general news coverage of this in Lexis, btw – only trade press coverage. This is a significant case involving the NY State Common Retirement Fund. This is a good example of accountability reporting in the trade press, the subject of my academic research.

Here’s an example of a terrific Washington Post report that used BrokerCheck to add a new dimension on a breaking news story. In 2012, staff Sgt Robert Bales was charged in the massacre of 16 villagers in Afghanistan. The Washington Post alertly noted his background as a broker and ran his name through the database.

#### Examine Complaints

![](images%20-%20storage/Bales%20dispute.png)

> Bales was charged with putting a customer into unsuitable investments. They claimed a $852,000 loss.

#### Look at the Arbitration Case

![](images%20-%20storage/Bales%20arbitration.png)

> BrokerCheck linked to the aribtration case file, which has 10 pages of detail about what Bales did. Bales and his firm were ordered to pay about $1.5 million, including punitive damages and attorneys fees.

### Tool for Checking Ongoing Case: Office of Hearing Officers

![](images%20-%20storage/Bales%20arbitration.png)

The Office of Hearing Officers page allows a detailed search of case by violation of particular FINRA rules. This can be a useful research tool to scoop up details about an ongoing case.

> There's **plenty of criticism** of BrokerCheck.
> --Limited search capability for disciplinary actions
> --Ability of brokers to scrub their histories

Here's a 2014 study by the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association

> <a href="https://piaba.org/in-the-media/piaba-warning-finra-withholds-critical-red-flag-information-broker-background-check" target="_blank">PIABA Critique of BrokerCheck: &quot;CNTL&quot; + click for a New Tab</a>

One finding: When a broker-dealer fired a registered broker, BrokerCheck reports excluded the reason for the termination and other commentary regarding the termination, although this information is available from states.

Finra disputed this, saying it will keep details that “implicate investor protection issues” but won't keep information that doesn’t address this. The PIABA also found information about whether a broker was ever under internal review for fraud is not reported by BrokerCheck, but is disclosed by states.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Reuters Series on BrokerCheck

![](images%20-%20storage/Reuters%20Finra.png)

An excellent 2017 Reuters investigation that scraped the FINRA data and analyzed it.

> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-finra-brokers-specialreport/special-report-regulator-blocks-public-scrutiny-of-firms-with-tainted-brokers-idUSKBN19327T" target="_blank">Reuters Series on BrokerCheck: &quot;CNTL&quot; + click for a New Tab</a>&gt;

Reuters found some 48 firms had at least 30 percent of brokers with FINRA disciplinary flags on their records. Reuters examined the 12 most serious incidents among the 23 that FINRA requires brokers to disclose. By comparison, 9 percent of brokers industry-wide have at least one of those 12 FINRA flags on their record.

Wall Street Journal reporters Jean Eaglesham and Rob Barry reported about problems and gaps in this database. In their March 5, 2014 article, Eaglesham and Barry compared BrokerCheck records to state regulators’ records and court filings and found that more than 1,600 brokers had bankruptcies or criminal charges that weren’t reported by FINRA.

Arkansas State Senator Jason Rapert, chairman of the Insurance Committee, is active nationally on these issues. What is his story?

He's employed at Rapert Financial & Associates, Inc. This is not listed in BrokerCheck but it is listed in IAPD database.

![](images%20-%20storage/Rapert%20insurance.jpeg)

#### Questions After Reviewing IAPD:

> --Discontinued Broker, Adviser Registration in August 2016. Why? What replaced that income?
> --Relationship of Rapert Financial to insurance industry? Affect of deregulation bills on Rapert?
> --What is Holy Ghost Ministries?

So far, **no smoking guns** but this is an efficient way to gain insight about a state senator’s background.

### Research Hedge Fund, Private Equity Fund Managers

> --Many hedge fund advisers will have to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The exception would be advisers who exclusively deal with venture capital funds or small hedge funds, those with less than $150 million in assets under management. If you want more details: <https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/hedgefundadvisers.shtml>
>
> --Also, if the hedge fund managers have obtained their Finra certifications such as the series 7 and series 65 licenses, then they will be in the BrokerCheck database. But this isn’t always required.
>
> --Example: Clayton Andrew Cohn
> ![](images%20-%20storage/Clayton%20Cohn%20IA.jpeg)
